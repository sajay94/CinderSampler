# Development

  - **Week 1** : Need to complete the following:
    
    [x] Create basic BufferPlayer from sample
    
    [X] Integrate AudioUnit cinderblock
    
  - **Week 2**
  
     [X] Split audio file into timestamps 
     corresponding to where audio picks up from silence.
     
     [X] Create draw functions for guide and dub audio
     
     [X] Create trace function to identify and draw timestamps
     
     [ ] Create algorithm to modify a single audio file based on timestamps
     
     
  - **4/28** 
   
     IMPORTANT Changing project to Audio Sampler
    
    [X] Create UI to select portion of sample
    
    [X] Make audio player repeat the sample
    
  - **4/29**
    
    [X] Create new file from the looped region
    
    [X] Add distortion and reverb over sample
    
  - **4/30**
  
        IMPORTANT Changing library to Cinder-UI
        
    [X] Integrated Cinder-UI
        
    [X] Adding panning and volume sliders
   
  - **5/1**
  
    [X] Remove AudioUnit library
    
    [X] Implement sample_controller to access and modify a single sample
    
  - **5/3**
    [X] Create single original sample and clipped sample buffer players
    
    [X] Create logic to take clip sample and copy to each of 16 SampleControllers
    
  - **5/4**
  
    [X] Create UI for sequencer and use Cinder-UI to control the first numSamples SampleControllers
    
    [X] Create UI to adjust each individual SampleController gain and pan
    
  - **5/5**
    
    [X] LowPass , HighPass UI
  
    [ ] Implement logic to export a finished sequence
    
    [ ] Create logic and UI to adjust compression, distortion, gain, reverb, and EQ from SampleController
    
    [ ] Add logic and UI for effects like delay and pitch 
        
    [ ] Add Tests and Debug
